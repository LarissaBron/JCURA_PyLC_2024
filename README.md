# Overview
Hello there! Welcome to the GitHub page for the JCURA 2024 project "Mountains of Confusion: Evaluating Image Enhancement to Improve AI Landscape Classification" by Larissa Bron. 

# Background
The [Mountain Legacy Project](https://mountainlegacy.ca/) (MLP) works with the largest systematic collection of mountain photographs in the world ([browse the collection](https://explore.mountainlegacy.ca/)). More than 10,000 historic images have been repeated to quantify landscape change over time. 

Quantitative comparison of how the distribution of ecosystems across the landscape change between historic and modern images requires pixel-by-pixel mapping of ecosystems. This time-consuming task has considerably held up scaling up the research team's investigation of the Canadian Rockies. 

To address this bottleneck, the [Python Landscape Classification](https://github.com/scrose/pylc) (PyLC) tool was developed to automate ecosystem classification using Artificial Intelligence (AI) semantic segmentation. PuLC is a proof-of-concept tool that has a high accuracy when working with images similar to the training data set and the MLP team is working to improve PyLC to better generalize to the larger image collection.
